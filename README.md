## Notes for instructor
As part of my job with teh Executive Council of Dubai, I work with all Government of Dubai Contact Centers measuring and reporting 286 KPIs every month.  These KPIs are part of the Contact Center standards that we established for the Government of Dubai.  I am trying to develop a set of calculators that these centers can use to help them calculate these KPIs based on data that they have. Initially, they will be accessed by users without the need to login. Eventually I would like to merge these calculators into a login page so that users can track teh results for each month. 

Also, I added the MyForm extended class.  However, for my project, I could have probably gotten away with adding teh function direclty into Form.php. Would that have been correct?
